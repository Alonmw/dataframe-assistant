# DataFrame Analysis Tool

This project is in work. the purpose of this project is to provide a structured Python-based framework to facilitate DataFrame analysis. It categorizes features by data type, assesses data quality, and offers detailed visual and textual analyses, including correlations with a target variable. The tool is modular and designed to assist developers in gaining insights into their datasets efficiently.

## Features

### 1. **Feature Categorization**
- Classifies DataFrame features into categories based on their data types:
  - Numerical: Continuous and discrete values.
  - Categorical: Nominal and ordinal values.
  - Boolean: Binary values.
  - Datetime: Timestamps and date-related data.
  - Text: Free-form text or strings.
  - Mixed: Columns with mixed or complex data types.

### 2. **Data Quality Assessment**
- Identifies missing values and calculates missing value percentages.
- Highlights duplicate rows.
- Provides summary statistics for numerical and categorical features.

### 3. **Visualization**
- Generates feature-specific graphs:
  - Distributions for numerical features.
  - Correlation plots with the target variable.
  - Text-specific visualizations like word clouds and text length distributions.

### 4. **Target Analysis**
- Analyzes the relationship between features and the target variable.
- Computes correlation coefficients and plots feature-specific insights.

### 5. **Text Analysis**
- Summarizes text statistics, such as word counts and unique word counts.
- Visualizes text data using distributions and word clouds.
- Evaluates the relationship between textual features and the target variable.
